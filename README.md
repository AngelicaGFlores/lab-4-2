Reflection Questions
After completing this lab, reflect on the following questions:

How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
- The push method helped add objecta to the array  but i haven't used the filter yet. 

What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
- the lab trying to filter was a challenge 

How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
- I would make sure the array objects had small text to add for each index. 
Otherwise how would the text reader know what the object is?
